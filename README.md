# SUMMâ–³RISE: AI Article Summariser 

Link to deployed site: [https://ai-article-summariser.netlify.app](https://ai-article-summariser.netlify.app)

## Description 

This project is an example of how to use the Article Extractor and Summarizer API provided by RapidAPI to extract and summarize text from articles using GPT, a powerful language model developed by OpenAI. With this API, you can easily extract the main content of a webpage and generate a summary that captures the key points of the article. The project also showcases the use of Redux Toolkit for state management, TailwindCSS for styling, and React.js as the front-end framework.

The ability to automatically extract and summarize text is incredibly useful in many different contexts. For example, news organizations can use this API to automatically generate summaries for breaking news stories, saving journalists time and effort. Researchers can use it to quickly summarize academic papers and identify key findings. And individuals can use it to extract the main points of a long article, allowing them to quickly understand the key concepts without having to read through the entire piece.

The Article Extractor and Summarizer API uses GPT, a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI. GPT is capable of generating high-quality summaries of text, making it an ideal choice for this API. Additionally, the API is provided by RapidAPI, which is a platform for building and consuming APIs. RapidAPI makes it easy to integrate APIs into your projects by providing a single, unified interface for working with a wide variety of APIs.

In this project, we use Redux Toolkit for state management. Redux Toolkit is a library for efficient Redux development that includes utilities for simplifying common Redux use cases. We also use TailwindCSS for styling, which is a utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom user interfaces. Finally, we use React.js as the front-end framework, which is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Overall, this project demonstrates the power of the Article Extractor and Summarizer API and how it can be easily integrated into a React.js project using Redux Toolkit. Whether you are a journalist, researcher, or just someone who wants to save time when reading articles, this API can help you quickly extract and summarize the main points of any text.
